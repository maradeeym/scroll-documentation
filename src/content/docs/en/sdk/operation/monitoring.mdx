Scroll SDK provides a comprehensive monitoring system to ensure the health and performance of the network. This section provides an overview of the monitoring tools and best practices for using them.

## `scroll-monitor` Service

The Scroll Monitor service provides a starting point for adding observability and monitoring to your Scroll SDK deployment. It brings together Grafana, Loki, Prometheus, and AlertManager to provide a comprehensive monitoring solution, or can serve as a template for implementing Scroll SDK into your existing monitoring stack.

### Service Dashboards

We've build and made available a few Grafana dashboards for Scroll SDK chains. These include views for the following services:
- `bridge-history-api`
- `bridge-history-fetcher`
- `chain-monitor`
- `coordinator-api`
- `coordinator-cron`
- `gas-oracle`
- `l2geth` instances (including `l2-sequencer`, `l2-bootnode` and `l2-rpc`)
- `rollup-node`

You can access these from the `scroll-sdk` repo [here](https://github.com/scroll-tech/scroll-sdk/tree/develop/charts/scroll-monitor/grafana/scroll-dashboards).

{/* <Aside type="caution">
Although these are configured to work out-of-the-box with the devnet deployment, you may need to make modifications if you're using your own Prometheus or Grafana configurations.
</Aside> */}

{/* <Aside type="tip">
We'll return to this section to provide more detailed overviews of how to identify some of the most useful metrics in each dashboard.
</Aside> */}

{/* TODO: List important views from various dashboards.  */}

### Notifications with Alertmanager

The `scroll-monitor` services configuration file also supports Slack webhooks for easy integration with your existing Slack workspace.

<ClickToZoom src={Alertmanager} alt="Example Slack Alert" />


{/* TODO: Document what we have alerts setup for. */}

For a detailed guide on configuring and setting up AlertManager, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/).

## Scroll Admin System

The Scroll Admin System Dashboard provides a web interface for managing and monitoring proof production in Scroll SDK deployments. It includes features for viewing the status of chunks, batches and bundles, along with all registered provers and assigned tasks.

<ClickToZoom src={AdminSystemDashboard} alt="Admin System Dashboard - Bundle View" />

{/* TODO: Consider describing what you can do in each view */}

{/* ## Balance Checker */}

{/* TODO: Return with simple overview of balance-checker, how to set it up, and what it does. */}

## Chain Monitor

Chain Monitor can be configured to send Slack notifications if:
- deposit and withdraw messages from L1 and L2 don't match
- asset value on escrow contracts doesn't match the deposit or withdraw messages
- WithdrawRoots don't match

To set this up, set a Webhook URL in the `slack_webhook_config` section of the `chain-monitor` config.

## Prometheus Metrics

Below are tables of Prometheus metrics for each service in the Scroll SDK:
