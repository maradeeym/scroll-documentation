Scroll SDK will include a comprehensive upgrade system to ensure the smooth operation of a network during upgrades. 

With our current `scroll-sdk 0.1.x` release, we haven't had any breaking changes that would require manual intervention beyond upgrading a chart's version. There may be some upgrades that will require re-syncing a sequencer from genesis, upgrading smart contracts, or even database migrations.

When that time comes, we will provide thorough documentation on upgrade paths for bringing the latest features to your Scroll SDK chain.
