## Introduction

Scroll SDK allows anyone to quickly deploy an instance of the Scroll zkEVM and its rollup architecture for deploying an L2 on Ethereum.

For an introduction on why, and how it fits into our broader multichain vision, read [Scroll SDK & Gadgets: Building the Foundation for Ethereum's Multichain Future](https://scroll.io/blog/scroll-sdk-and-gadgets-building-the-foundation-for-ethereums-multichain-future).

We're working with a number of clients, technology parters, and service providers to build the most robust ZK stack for Ethereum.

If you want to dive deeper and try launching your own L2, keep reading and check out the additional resources.

## Current Feature Set

- Fully functional local devnet or Sepolia testnet deployment of Scroll's current zkEVM and protocol
- Configurable deployment using Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm
- Choose between Ether or any ERC20 token as the native gas token
- Plug-and-play proof generation using various service providers, allowing for failover and elastic capacity
- Adaptable finality time, allowing custom trade-offs between finality time and on-chain costs
- Tools for interacting and exploring your chain, including a CLI tool, Blockscout, Grafana dashboards, our Rollup Explorer, and a demo Bridge UI

## Planned Feature Set

- Rollup or Validium Mode (Modular DA using 4844, callData, or Alt-DA Layers)
- Base layer flexibility (Ethereum mainnet, Scroll, or any EVM-compatible environment)
- Customization of the sequencer node to add additional features to the EVM
- Out-of-the-box, contract auto-deployments for various commonly used protocols

<Aside type="danger">
Scroll SDK shares the same risks, centralized components, and rollup maturity as Scroll chain. We're building fast, but itâ€™s worth being familiar with the [L2Beat assessment of Scroll](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/scroll#).
